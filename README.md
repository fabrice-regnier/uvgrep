UniVersal Grep (uvgrep)

The `uvgrep` tool lets you grep text, PDF and LibreOffice/OpenOffice (ODF) files simultaneously. It requires that `bash` (for `getopts`), `grep`, `pdfgrep`, `sed`, `xmllint`, and `unzip` (for unpacking *odt*, *odp* and *ods* files) are installed.

## Installation
Get the file `uvgrep`, make sure it is executable (`chmod a+x uvgrep`), and move it to a folder which is in the `PATH` variable, e. g. `/usr/local/bin`. Check that the required tools (see above) are installed.

## Usage
`uvgrep [options] [files]`

#### Options
`-i`: ignore case

`-n`: output line numbers (text) or page numbers (PDF)

#### Limitations
The current and initial version of `uvgrep` relies solely on filename extensions and should be modified to use the output of the `file` program. 

`uvgrep` cannot detect on which pages of an ODF document a search term was found.

`uvgrep` uses German error messages for the two problems that can occur (file not found, unsupported file type).

#### Example

```
[esser@quad:~]$ uvgrep -in libreoffice *.sh *.pdf *.odt
uvgrep.sh:5:# uvgrep: grep txt, PDF and LibreOffice files
uvgrep.pdf:1:   5 # uvgrep: grep txt, PDF and LibreOffice files
test.odt:<text:p text:style-name="Standard">Das ist ein kleiner Test-Text, in dem das Wort "LibreOffice" vorkommt.</text:p>
```

## Name Choice
`uvgrep` was meant to be named "ugrep" (universal grep), but a different project already uses that name, so I picked "uvgrep".
